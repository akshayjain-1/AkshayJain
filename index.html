                        <p>"We come across many students every year and few leave a lasting impression. Akshay is one of them. Akshay is a dedicated, eager learner and a smart student. As a student, , Akshay consistently strived to do better and looked for answers to everyday concerns in engineering logic. 
                            I was his guide and interacted very closely with him during the final year project on “Detection and Prevention of Cyberattacks on Mobile Networks”. I found him to be hands-on with all relevant information in his work. Despite stretching goals and other academic pressures, Akshay not only worked on the entire project but also designed the project timelines and accountabilities. He was a good motivator to the team, worked on fixed time schedule and his inclination towards practical training and research was evident from his commitment towards understanding even the most difficult of concepts. 
                            His friendly nature and communicative personality and the confident aura around him make him dependable. Considering his initiative to do independent as well as directed research, I have no hesitation in recommending one of our best students"</p>
